bibtex_cleanup_parser
===================

Bibtex Cleanup Parser in Python 2.7 and 3.

This is a fork of sciunto-org/python-bibtexparser
(https://github.com/sciunto-org/python-bibtexparser).

This fork is mostly identical to the original version however key
additions in error checking were introduced.

Ultimately the aim of this fork is to provide a parsing tool for the
BibTeX Cleanup tool (TODO url).
